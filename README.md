# Data-Driven Insights into Medication Errors Across Healthcare Settings
***

## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes real-world medication safety incident data from the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) in England and Wales to identify patterns, clinical risk, and workflow vulnerabilities in medication errors. The analysis focuses on error types, harm severity, contributing factors, and variation across medication use processes, care settings, and locations. Insights support patient safety, quality improvement, and process optimization.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Dose, strength, and omission errors drive the highest incident counts  
       ✓ Most errors result in low or no harm, while moderate-to-severe events are consistently reported  
       ✓ Administration and prescribing stages are most prone to errors  
       ✓ Errors cluster in hospitals and inpatient areas, with other care settings less affected  
       ✓ Guideline-related errors occur most frequently with local or commonly used guidelines  

## Key Features 🔑

       ✓ Data cleansing and preparation, including handling missing or blank values  
       ✓ Overview of medication error patterns by type and implicated drugs  
       ✓ Harm severity stratification to highlight clinically significant events  
       ✓ Analysis of drivers and context via guideline cause categories and workflow stages  
       ✓ Spatial and temporal variation analysis to identify error hotspots and trends  

## Technologies Used 🛠️

       ✓ Python  
       ✓ Pandas  
       ✓ Seaborn  
       ✓ Matplotlib  
       ✓ Squarify  
       ✓ SQLite3  
       ✓ Jupyter Notebook
